class LigandScorer:
    """ Scorer to compute various small molecule ligand (non polymer) scores.

    :class:`LigandScorer` is an abstract base class dealing with all the setup,
    data storage, enumerating ligand symmetries and target/model ligand
    matching/assignment. But actual score computation is delegated to child
    classes.

    At the moment, two such classes are available:

    * :class:`ost.mol.alg.ligand_scoring_lddtpli.LDDTPLIScorer`
      that assesses the conservation of protein-ligand
      contacts (LDDT-PLI);
    * :class:`ost.mol.alg.ligand_scoring_scrmsd.SCRMSDScorer`
      that computes a binding-site superposed, symmetry-corrected RMSD
      (BiSyRMSD) and ligand pocket LDDT (LDDT-LP).

    All versus all scores are available through the lazily computed
    :attr:`score_matrix`. However, many things can go wrong... be it even
    something as simple as two ligands not matching. Error states therefore
    encode scoring issues. An Issue for a particular ligand is indicated by a
    non-zero state in :attr:`model_ligand_states`/:attr:`target_ligand_states`.
    This invalidates pairwise scores of such a ligand with all other ligands.
    This and other issues in pairwise score computation are reported in
    :attr:`state_matrix` which has the same size as :attr:`score_matrix`.
    Only if the respective location is 0, a valid pairwise score can be
    expected. The states and their meaning can be explored with code::

      for state_code, (short_desc, desc) in scorer_obj.state_decoding.items():
          print(state_code)
          print(short_desc)
          print(desc)

    A common use case is to derive a one-to-one mapping between ligands in
    the model and the target for which :class:`LigandScorer` provides an
    automated :attr:`assignment` procedure.
    By default, only exact matches between target and model ligands are
    considered. This is a problem when the target only contains a subset
    of the expected atoms (for instance if atoms are missing in an
    experimental structure, which often happens in the PDB). With
    `substructure_match=True`, complete model ligands can be scored against
    partial target ligands. One problem with this approach is that it is
    very easy to find good matches to small, irrelevant ligands like EDO, CO2
    or GOL. The assignment algorithm therefore considers the coverage,
    expressed as the fraction of atoms of the model ligand atoms covered in the
    target. Higher coverage matches are prioritized, but a match with a better
    score will be preferred if it falls within a window of `coverage_delta`
    (by default 0.2) of a worse-scoring match. As a result, for instance,
    with a delta of 0.2, a low-score match with coverage 0.96 would be
    preferred over a high-score match with coverage 0.70.

    Assumptions:

    Unlike most of OpenStructure, this class does not assume that the ligands
    (either for the model or the target) are part of the PDB component
    dictionary. They may have arbitrary residue names. Residue names do not
    have to match between the model and the target. Matching is based on
    the calculation of isomorphisms which depend on the atom element name and
    atom connectivity (bond order is ignored).
    It is up to the caller to ensure that the connectivity of atoms is properly
    set before passing any ligands to this class. Ligands with improper
    connectivity will lead to bogus results.

    This only applies to the ligand. The rest of the model and target
    structures (protein, nucleic acids) must still follow the usual rules and
    contain only residues from the compound library. Structures are cleaned up
    according to constructor documentation. We advise to
    use the :func:`MMCIFPrep` and :func:`PDBPrep` for loading which already
    clean hydrogens and, in the case of MMCIF, optionally extract ligands ready
    to be used by the :class:`LigandScorer` based on "non-polymer" entity types.
    In case of PDB file format, ligands must be loaded separately as SDF files.

    Only polymers (protein and nucleic acids) of model and target are considered
    for ligand binding sites. The
    :class:`ost.mol.alg.chain_mapping.ChainMapper` is used to enumerate possible
    mappings of these chains. In short: identical chains in the target are
    grouped based on pairwise sequence identity
    (see pep_seqid_thr/nuc_seqid_thr param). Each model chain is assigned to
    one of these groups (see mdl_map_pep_seqid_thr/mdl_map_nuc_seqid_thr param).
    To avoid spurious matches, only polymers of a certain length are considered
    in this matching procedure (see min_pep_length/min_nuc_length param).
    Shorter polymers are never mapped and do not contribute to scoring.

    Here is an example of how to setup a scorer::

        from ost.mol.alg.ligand_scoring_scrmsd import SCRMSDScorer

        # Load data
        # Structure model in PDB format, containing the receptor only
        model = PDBPrep("path_to_model.pdb")
        # Ligand model as SDF file
        model_ligand = io.LoadEntity("path_to_ligand.sdf", format="sdf")
        # Target loaded from mmCIF, containing the ligand
        target, target_ligands = MMCIFPrep("path_to_target.cif",
                                           extract_nonpoly=True)

        # Setup scorer object and compute SCRMSD
        model_ligands = [model_ligand.Select("ele != H")]
        sc = SCRMSDScorer(model, target, model_ligands, target_ligands)

        # Perform assignment and read respective scores
        for lig_pair in sc.assignment:
            trg_lig = sc.target_ligands[lig_pair[0]]
            mdl_lig = sc.model_ligands[lig_pair[1]]
            score = sc.score_matrix[lig_pair[0], lig_pair[1]]
            print(f"Score for {trg_lig} and {mdl_lig}: {score}")

        # check cleanup in model and target structure:
        print("model cleanup:", sc.model_cleanup_log)
