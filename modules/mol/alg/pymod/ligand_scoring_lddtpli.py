    """ :class:`LigandScorer` implementing lDDT-PLI.

    lDDT-PLI is an lDDT score considering contacts between ligand and
    receptor. Where receptor consists of protein and nucleic acid chains that
    pass the criteria for :class:`chain mapping <ost.mol.alg.chain_mapping>`.
    This means ignoring other ligands, waters, short polymers as well as any
    incorrectly connected chains that may be in proximity.

    :class:`LDDTPLIScorer` computes a score for a specific pair of target/model
    ligands. Given a target/model ligand pair, all possible mappings of
    model chains onto their chemically equivalent target chains are enumerated.
    For each of these enumerations, all possible symmetries, i.e. atom-atom
    assignments of the ligand as given by :class:`LigandScorer`, are evaluated
    and an lDDT-PLI score is computed. The best possible lDDT-PLI score is
    returned.

    By default, classic lDDT is computed. That means, contacts within
    *lddt_pli_radius* are identified in the target and checked if they're
    conserved in the model. Added contacts are not penalized. That means if
    the ligand is nicely placed in the correct pocket, but that pocket now
    suddenly interacts with MORE residues in the model, you still get a high
    score. You can penalize for these added contacts with the
    *add_mdl_contacts* flag. This additionally considers contacts within
    *lddt_pli_radius* in the model but only if the involved atoms can
    be mapped to the target. This is a requirement to 1) extract the respective
    reference distance from the target 2) avoid usage of contacts for which
    we have no experimental evidence. One special case are
    contacts from chains that are NOT mapped to the target binding site. It is
    very well possible that we have experimental evidence for this chain though
    its just too far away from the target binding site.
    We therefore try to map these contacts to the chain in the target with
    equivalent sequence that is closest to the target binding site. If the
    respective atoms can be mapped there, the contact is considered not
    fulfilled and added as penalty.

    Populates :attr:`LigandScorer.aux_data` with following :class:`dict` keys:

    * lddt_pli: The score
    * lddt_pli_n_contacts: Number of contacts considered in lDDT computation
    * target_ligand: The actual target ligand for which the score was computed
    * model_ligand: The actual model ligand for which the score was computed
    * bs_ref_res: :class:`set` of residues with potentially non-zero
                  contribution to score. That is every residue with at least one
                  atom within *lddt_pli_radius* + max(*lddt_pli_thresholds*) of
                  the ligand.
    * bs_mdl_res: Same for model
